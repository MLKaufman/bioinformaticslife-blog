    "## Introduction\n",
    "Having recently completed my PhD thesis work, I have begun to shift gears in terms of the type of my research and training. For the last 15 years in the biological sciences I have been primarily at the bench performing 'wet' lab experiments and only supporting them a small fraction of the time using computational approaches. Now as I begin my post doctoral training my focus will be in the persuit of applying computational and bioinformatics approaches full-time. To facilitate this I have decided to document the process and the recipes gathered along the way by means of this static blog site deployed from GitHub and managed using the Python package Nikola.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why a static site?  \n",
    "A static site is free from server side code and has minimal hosting requirements.  This allows for a lightweight site based on mostly pure HTML. Many hosting solutions will also serve your static website for free such as GitHub and DigitalOcean.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Site requirements\n",
    "There are multiple goals for this project that require proper documentation of coding, pipelines, and workflows related to bioinformatics. Therefore I came up with several required capabilities for the blog site.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   static site (pre-generated HTML with no need for server side processing)\n",
    "*   ability to post formated highlighted code and output\n",
    "*   support for displaying multiple languages (Python, R, bash, etc.)\n",
    "*   ability to use multiple source documents (reStructured txt, markdown, Jupyter .ipynb)  \n",
    "* deploy from GitHub (CI/CD)\n",

    "## The Setup\n",
    "Ultimately the tool that fit all of the requirements above was [Nikola](https://getnikola.com/). This is a static site generator that is fully featured with many plugins. Basically it is a command line tool that manages local folders on your computer. You create a blog post using reStructured txt, markdown, or Jupyter .ipynb and then using the command line tool add it to the Nikola managed site source. Luckily all the features we need come built-in without having to install any additional plugins.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Install Nikola\n",
    "I use [pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx) as a way to isolate python packages into their own environment and run them as command line tools. It is essentially python pip but installs each package and its requirements in a way that doesn't conflict with anything else on the system. Pipx also places executables and scripts in your path so that they can be run on the command line. (In the future I will dive deeper into my local setup.) Installing Nikola with pipx is as simple as:\n",
    "\n",
    "`pipx install Nikola[extras]`  \n",
    "`pipx inject Nikola ghp-import --include-apps --include-deps`\n",
    "\n",
    "* `[extras]` allows some bonus features like .ipynb support.  \n",
    "* `pipx inject Nikola ghp-import` adds the extra package `ghp-import` required for `github_deploy` directly into the same virtual environment with Nikola.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initialization\n",
    "Initializing a new blog is as simple as creating a new directory, navigating to it and running:  \n",
    "\n",
    "`nikola init`\n",
    "\n",
    "This command will walk through asking questions setting up things like blog name, authors, email, and language.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The end result of this step will create several folders and files that make up and manage the enitre blog. Importantly the `conf.py` is the configuration file that will be used to control everything from the themes, adding pages, and customizing the git settings. Couple of other folder related things to note relevant to us:\n",
    "* `posts` - Once imported or created this is the folder where it will store the raw posts after they are imported. Edit these files in the future to change or update the posts.\n",
    "* `pages` - Similar rules to the `posts` folder. This is the location for non-blog related pages such as About, Information, Contact, etc.\n",
    "* `output` - After the `nikola build` command has been run the `output` folder will be propagated with the static html files that will be the final product rendered as the blog site. This needs to rebuilt with the `build` command when any posts or pages are updated or new content imported.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create a git repository\n",
    "Within the newly initialized Nikola folder a git repository will be setup to track development changes and for automatic deployment from GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "`git init . `  \n",
    "`git remote add origin https://github.com/mlkaufman/bioinformaticslife-blog.git`\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a `.gitignore` file and add the following lines: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "  cache  \n",
    "  .doit.db*  \n",
    "  __pycache__  \n",
    "  output  \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Configuration and Customization\n",
    "To setup the majority of the site I distilled several tutorials starting with the one at [https://jiaweizhuang.github.io/blog/nikola-guide/](https://jiaweizhuang.github.io/blog/nikola-guide/). Customization of the blog generated by Nikola is done through editing the `config.py` file found in the root directory created upon initialization. The [Nikola handbook](https://getnikola.com/handbook.html) is a great reference. [http://www.jaakkoluttinen.fi/blog/how-to-blog-with-jupyter-ipython-notebook-and-nikola/](http://www.jaakkoluttinen.fi/blog/how-to-blog-with-jupyter-ipython-notebook-and-nikola/) was another handy tutorial for setting up the page to work with `github_deploy`.  \n",
